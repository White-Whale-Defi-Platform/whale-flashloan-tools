### What are Flashloans

Flash Loans allow you to borrow any available amount of assets without putting up any collateral, as long as the liquidity is returned to the protocol within one block transaction. - [Source: AAVE](https://docs.aave.com/faq/flash-loans)

### Acknowledgements 

A particular massive shout-out to CyberHoward and Astromartian for their internal contributions on flash loans. Both could easily be considered thought leaders.
